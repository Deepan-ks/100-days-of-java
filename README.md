# 100 Days of Java ðŸš€

Welcome to my 100-day journey of re-learning Java! 
This repository documents my progress as I dedicate time each day to explore various Java concepts & work on hands-on exercises.

**Goal:** ðŸŽ¯

My goal for this 100-day challenge is to solidify my understanding of core Java & learning advanced topics by building practical projects.

**How It Works:** âœ…

Each day, I will:

* Focus on learning or reviewing a specific Java concept.
* Write code examples and practice exercises to reinforce my understanding.
* Document my learnings and code for that day in a dedicated folder.
* Push the code and documentation to this GitHub repository.

**Let's Learn Together!** ðŸ˜Š

I'm excited to embark on this learning journey. Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or suggest topics. Happy coding!
